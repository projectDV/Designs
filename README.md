This branch contains various Decoder_Encoder models.

Basic Definition: Encoder
An encoder is a combinational circuit that converts binary information in the form of a 2N input lines into N output lines, which represent N bit code for the input. For simple encoders, it is assumed that only one input line is active at a time.
